            "\n",
            "1. Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): The 4% LIHTC is competitive due to the increased efficiency requirements for projects with at least 10,000 square feet of gross floor area. Projects must comply with net zero energy requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Private Activity Bond Volume Cap (Bond Cap): Issued by the District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA), the Bond Cap is associated with LIHTCs and is competitive. Projects must meet efficiency requirements and at least 15% of the total cost must be financed by the District.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Operating Subsidies through the Local Rent Supplement Program (LRSP): Administered by the DC Housing Authority (DCHA), operating subsidies are now determined by unit characteristics rather than submarket rent limits.\n",

            "4. DC Green Bank: Provides reduced-interest construction and permanent loans for clean energy, energy, and resource efficiency, and resilience improvements.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP): Provides funding for energy efficiency and resilience measures in affordable housing projects.\n",

            "Each financing option brings unique benefits and value to the project, such as access to capital, reduced-interest loans, funding for energy efficiency and resilience measures, and technical assistance for compliance with energy performance standards. Compliance requirements vary for each option and may include net zero energy compliance, installation of solar panels, building electrification, and completion of assessments and certifications.
